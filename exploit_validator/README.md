# Exploit Validator based on Playwright

## URL encoding

In case we want to emulate legacy behavior such as used by Internet Explorer (not Edge!) we have to patch playwright, as it performs URL encoding. A patch as well as a script to apply it is provided [here](patches/apply.sh). When successfully applied one can set the `PW_NO_URL_ENCODING` environment variable to an arbitrary value to disable the playwright based URL encoding and use the browser's behavior.
