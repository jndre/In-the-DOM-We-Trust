# Exploit Generator
> An automated exploit generation for Cross-site Scripting attacks, that allows the verfification 
of XSS vulnerabilites in websites with Foxhound.

## 1. General
Exploit Generator is a JavaScript module, that creates URL-based XSS exploits based on data flow 
information from Foxhound and Taintnode. The module is primarily focused on DOM-based XSS 
exploits, but is also applicable for reflected and stored XSS exploits. In combination with 
Foxhound and a  exploit validation system, this module allows to verifiy actual vulnerabilites in 
websites. This prevents the reporting of false positive findings and gives an example for an 
attack with benign payload.

## 2. Installation

1. Change directory
   ```shell
   $ cd exploit-generator
   ```

2. Install dependencies with NPM:
    ```shell
    $ npm install
    ```

3. Run the exploit generator as a server: 
    ```shell
    $ npm start
    ```
   Alternatively build a stand-alone JavaScript module:
   ```shell
   $ npm run build
   ```
   The module script  *exploitGenerator.js* can be found in the build direcotry.

## 3. Usage

### Server
Send a POST request with a given finding to the exploit generator server. The server will return a JSON with an array of generated, but not validated exploits.

### Module
Require the module script or include it with a script tag, depending on your environment. The exploit generator offers the following global function:
