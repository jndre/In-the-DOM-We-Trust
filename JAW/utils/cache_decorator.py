    A Function Memoization Decorator:
    -----------------------
        1. Set up a cache data structure for function results
        2. Every time the function is called, do one of the following:
            2.1. Return the cached result, if any; or
            2.2. Call the function to compute the missing result, and then update the cache
    
    Usage
    -----------------------
    >> memoized_func = memozie(my_function)


    Important Note:
    -----------------------
    You can also use the default @functools.lru_cache decorator over this custom version
        >> import functools
        >> 
            @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=128)
            def my_function():
                ...
